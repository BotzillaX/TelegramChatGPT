,

I am trying to use the "Create a new project" feature in the JIRA Cloud. I am getting the following error:

"We're sorry, but something went wrong.

We've been notified about this issue and we'll take a look at it shortly."

I have tried multiple times and I am still getting the same error. I have also tried using different browsers and clearing my cache, but nothing seems to work.

Can you please help me with this issue?

Thanks,
